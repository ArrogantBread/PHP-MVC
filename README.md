# PHP-MVC (WIP)
Basic PHP MVC framework, because the wheel can be improved... probably

note: PSR-4 is used for the autoloading of classes, that is the only use of composer here

**This is a basic PHP MVC framework**
The goal here was for me to learn the principles of MVC

Feel free to use/adapt/modify this however it is ill advised!
